# horiseon-refactor

## Refactor of HTML and CCS code

The purpose of this project was to practice refactoring using semantic HTML to support SEO and accessibility, as well as to practice identifying and cleaning up redundant code in CSS.
I learned a variety of new semantic HTML tags, as well as how to target multiple selectors in CSS. This also gave me the oportunity to practice commenting to explain or describe changes that were made.
